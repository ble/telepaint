Mural:

Choose a picture, chop it up into chunks, and draw it freehand in your browser
with friends.

Major project components:

Erlang http server;
Javascript client code to run in browser, written for / analyzed and compiled
by the lovely Google Closure Compiler;
and of course a wild (and wildly optimistic) idea:
Erlang port driver using V8 to execute Javascript, simulate clients using
client code.  Meaningful load testing without a complete rewrite of client
code, taking advantage of Erlang's capabilities for launching a bazumptillion
processes.

Goal:
Write some stuff that works, have fun.  Accept that any amount of progress is
pretty stunning given that you will be spending most of this weekend with your
lovely S.O., who for some reason tolerates your madness. :)

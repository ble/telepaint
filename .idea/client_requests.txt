OMG chunked responses are so sexy.

It's unclear how well they will work with the httpc module and/or the XHR
interface, but I want 'em.  It's also unclear whether they can tell if the
browser is still actually listening to the response...


Okay,

Creator:
GET persistent chunked-response request (should it ever error or complete,
start it again with a little time delay)
POST image URL
{chunk-back} server URL of the appropriate image OR
             some manner of error indicating that the given url is bunk
POST tile size in pixels, # of rows and columns
{chunk-back} ok, URLs for participants and observers OR
             error, your tile sizes are jacked bro try again
Long period of chilling out while the following occur:
[{chunk-back} somebody chats something OR
             somebody starts observing OR
             a participant picks a name OR
             a participant draws a stroke,
 POST chat message]
POST "it's done!"
{chunk-back} ok; here's the URL you should go to to view this lovely mural now
that it's done!

Participant:
GET persistent chunked-response request
{chunk-back} mural image URL (on mural server)
             all strokes up to the current time
POST the name (pseudonym, really) of this participant
{chunk-back} okay, your pseudonym looks legit to me
POST each stroke as it is drawn by the participant on the canvas
POST chat message
{chunk-back} each stroke as it is drawn by other participants on the canvas OR
             chat messages OR
             creator calling the mural done

Observer:
Same as the participant, only no posting strokes.

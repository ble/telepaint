x Review what you've done.

x Make an initial build/debug system for the client components.

x Test Closure CRMC with current server

x Fix issues with the Closure CRMC

o Describe how the server will be implemented in terms of mnesia tables,
  chunked responses, and processes / gen_server or gen_fsms

o Make the server design more concrete and implement as much of it as
  possible.

o Design the general structure of the Javascript client(s), identifying func-
  tionality common to more than one part, taking care to decouple canvas
  drawing from server-client communication from all things DOM.

o Implement and test the Javascript client for the mural creator.

o Implement and test the Javascript client for a mural participant.

o Identify what portion of the previous clients is necessary to create a
  "headless" participant client and what would need to be added.  Assume
  no browser functionality except for XMLHttpRequest (to be provided by C++
  code linked with V8) and cookies (to be provided by everyone's favorite
  module, httpc).

o Take a fucking break and draw some goofy pictures using mural.  Are you even
  going to get this far?  Who cares? :)

o Read up on port drivers in greater detail.

o Think about what behavior your crazy V8 port driver (which will provide
  XHR functionality through calling back into httpc... okay, maybe we need a
  port driver and a module or two wrapping it to provide this functionality,
  but you get the gist) will require.

o Write a trivial port driver and wrapper module that will achieve some of the
  tricky aspects of the calling back and forth:
  public wrapper api -> port driver
  port driver -> httpc
  asynchronously completing httpc -> port driver
  etc.

o Be utterly amazed if you have any clue what you are doing at this point.

o Define the structure of the V8 port driver and its wrapper code.

o Implement the port driver and test it sans wrapper code.

o Implement wrapper code.

o Wait for pigs to fly.

o Realize Spawnfest ended two months ago.

WHY ARE THESE PREVIOUS GOALS SO TL;DR?

Next goals: 
 Undo plan:
  Painter has
    canonical representation of drawing; how drawing will be saved and transmitted
    playback representation of drawing; all strokes and undos, times scaled for playback
    intermediate representation of drawing:
      call method to indicate that you are starting animation of the drawing
       ---> side effects creating new empty intermediate representation
      call method indicating the time at which the drawing will next be painted
      ---> walk playback representation: 
        process every item that starts between the last update time and the new one:
          replays are added as "pushes".
          undos are executed as "pops".  

  In creating a drawing, undos push an undo onto the canonical representation and thus pop a replay off
  the actual painting; redos pop an undo off the canonical representation IFF the last item in the
  canonical representation is an undo.  Because redos remove the original undo from the canonical
  representation, undoing and redoing one or more times WILL NOT APPEAR IN THE PLAYBACK.

  Alternative: can we allow people to be really annoying and undo/redo things multiple times?  well, if
  we're taking the time to make undos behave nicely with this whole canonical/playback/intermediate
  representation, it may be worth doing as it won't make things that much MORE complicated...

Not sure I like the way it's going; too many responsibilities in one place.
Seems like if I just started by adding an undo button and wiring things up,
I might well come up with a simpler solution.


Still valid goals:
  Animate multiple drawings in sequence (events on end of animation)
  Add drawing functionality for a "table view" or "race view" w/ panning, zooming

New goal:
  Play, pause, ffw, rewind animation of drawings / stacks / games

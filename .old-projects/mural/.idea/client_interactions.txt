Client-server interactions

Creator:
Provide image URL
See server's loaded version of image, confirm it is okay
Provide server with number of rows and columns, tile size in pixels.
Receive urls for each tile and for observers.


Participant:
Receive the mural image and the portion to be drawn
Synchronize with the drawing strokes that have already been completed
[for now, avoid anything that might make maintaining the correct canvas image
more complicated than simply drawing all completed strokes then drawing each
new stroke as it comes in]
Send drawing strokes to the server
See others strokes filling in other portions of the mural
(strictly client side:
  choose color and stroke width
  toggle mural background
  pan about the mural and see others' sections)

Observer:
Receive drawing strokes already completed
Receive new drawing strokes as they come in

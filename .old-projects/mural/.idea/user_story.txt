(parenthetical comments indicate the simple, dumb, hacky ways things will be
made to work in the limited time... parenthetical comments will hopefully be
brief.)

User authorized to start games goes to game creation URL.
(this will be a fixed, "secret" URL for starters.)

User provides an image that will form the basis of the mural.
(image will be provided as a URL which the server will fetch; no time to futz
about with javascript file uploading and such?)

User determines the number of rows and columns the mural will be broken into.

User is given a URL or URLs to distribute to potential participants.
(one unique URL per block and a single URL for any / all observers?)
(one URL for all observers and then the creator assigns one to each block?)
(the former.)

Participants are assigned to a chunk of the mural either automatically or
through the actions of the mural creator.
(participants assigned automatically, their URL uniquely identifies which
mural part they will work on.)

Participants begin drawing.  Their individual strokes are transmitted to the
server and timestamped so that the drawing may be replayed.
(not actually tricky.)

A participant may release a part of a mural or be booted from it; they may
call their portion done, or they may fail to be connected to the server for an
extended period of time, or the mural creator may boot them.

The mural creator can call the mural done.  Now the drawings on all the tiles
are rendered to canvas, transmitted back to server as images, stored for all
time.  The strokes and their timing are also stored.

People can view completed murals.

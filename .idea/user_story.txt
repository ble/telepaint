User authorized to start games goes to game creation URL.

User provides an image that will form the basis of the mural.

User determines the number of rows and columns the mural will be broken into.

User is given a URL or URLs to distribute to potential participants.

Participants are assigned to a chunk of the mural either automatically or
through the actions of the mural creator.

Participants begin drawing.  Their individual strokes are transmitted to the
server and timestamped so that the drawing may be replayed.

A participant may release a part of a mural or be booted from it; they may
call their portion done, or they may fail to be connected to the server for an
extended period of time, or the mural creator may boot them.

The mural creator can call the mural done.  Now the drawings on all the tiles
are rendered to canvas, transmitted back to server as images, stored for all
time.  The strokes and their timing are also stored.

People can view completed murals.

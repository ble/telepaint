Mural:

Choose a picture, chop it up into chunks, and draw it freehand in your browser
with friends.

Major project components:

Erlang http server;
Javascript client code to run in browser, written for / analyzed and compiled
by the lovely Google Closure Compiler;
and of course a wild (and wildly optimistic) idea:
Erlang port driver using V8 to execute Javascript, simulate clients using
client code.  Meaningful load testing without a complete rewrite of client
code, taking advantage of Erlang's capabilities for launching a bazumptillion
processes.

Goal:
Write some stuff that works, have fun.
Accept that 5 hours out of 48 have passed and you won't write any code until
you've slept, woken up, and eaten.
Try to enjoy the process of planning this stuff.

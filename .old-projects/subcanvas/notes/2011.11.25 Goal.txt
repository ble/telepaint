So the goal right now is to enable good animations.

What's a good animation?
Multiple drawings occurring simultaneously.
New pages / sheets sliding across the screen.

I've already done a refactoring of drawing things so that they can be more easily time-sliced.

I can either backfit that onto the existing UI stuff or I can move ahead and try to make a composition of drawings so that they can be fully animated...

Backfit it is.  Good to finish refactorings before you forget what you were doing.

Okay, part of the refactor is to make an immutable drawing and a mutable drawing.
The mutable drawing needs to have a 'currently being drawn' draw item.
It would be nice if I could have multiple items currently being drawn, but that's
actually kinda tricky.

REVISIT: multiple 'currently being drawn items' for multi-person drawing.



Time alignment of shit is not right. Durn.

OKAY, turns out I was just getting too tired to program. Loool.


Okay, next step: multi-drawing replay.
